This directory contains all of the relevant data files and R codes for a
 statistical analysis of the Dun-Humby Complete Journey set of grocery store information files.  
Using a combination of Python and R coding, our team created several different statistical models and decided that Random Forests were the best fit for our grocery store data.  
Our overall goal for the data is to predict total sales value for each household in the study based on demographic predictors.

SalesRegression.R has all of the relevant source files, while the data directory has the .csv files that supplied the original data.
