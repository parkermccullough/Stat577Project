## Data Loading Preliminaries

```{r}
# Preliminaries
# Data was preprocessed using python with Pandas library, see code/.py
# Load the data from CSV files, Change to absolute path of data
# setwd("/Users/roshanak/Dropbox/UTK/Fall2016/STAT576/HW3/Journey/Journey_CSV")
cust = read.csv(file="transaction_data.csv", header=TRUE)
demo = read.csv(file="demo_ToCategorical.csv", header=TRUE)

head(cust)
summary(cust)

stmt <- "SELECT household_key,DAY,STORE_ID,RETAIL_DISC,TRANS_TIME,WEEK_NO,COUPON_DISC,
COUPON_MATCH_DISC,
sum(SALES_VALUE) AS TotalValue
FROM cust
GROUP BY household_key"
trans1 <- sqldf(stmt)

DF = merge(demo, trans1, ,by="household_key")
DF$TRANS_TIME_Cat <- cut(DF$TRANS_TIME,
                     breaks=c(56, 1200, 1201, 2354),
                     labels=c("morning","afternoon","evening"))
write.csv(DF,file="DF.csv")
```
The above chunk creates the final .CSV file that creates our datafrom of interest. All of our analysis will be performed on DF.csv.

```{r}
DF = read.csv("DF.csv")
head(DF)
```
